# 💰 React Tip Calculator

An interactive tool built with React.js that helps users calculate the total bill including tips based on their personal and their friends' satisfaction levels.

## 🚀 Features
- **Dynamic Calculation:** Automatically calculates the total amount and tip as you change the inputs.
- **Service Rating:** Includes a dropdown menu to rate service from 0% (Dissatisfied) to 20% (Absolutely Amazing!).
- **Friend's Input:** Factors in a friend's opinion to average the tip percentage.
- **Reset Functionality:** A dedicated button to clear all fields and start over.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **React.js:** Functional components and Hooks (`useState`).
- **CSS3:** Custom styling for a clean and responsive user interface.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `App.js`: Main entry point and layout wrapper.
- `section.js`: Contains the core logic for inputs, calculations, and state management.
- `Section.css`: Custom styles for input fields and select menus.

## 💡 Learning Outcomes
This project was developed to practice:
1. Managing multiple related states in React.
2. Handling controlled components (inputs and selects).
3. Conditional rendering (showing the total only when a bill amount exists).
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
